# Max3Sat
Genetic algorithm to solve the boolean satisfiability problem for the max3sat problem.
Max3Sat is an optimization problem in computational complexity theory that involves finding an assignment of Boolean values to variables that maximizes the number of clauses that are satisfied.
We are given a logical formula consisting of clauses, where each clause is composed of three literals (variable or their negations). The clause is fulfilled if at least one of their variables are matched with solution.
The goal of this algorithm is to find the best solution in limited time.
The solution is based on a genetic algorithm using crossovers, mutations and migrations between different populations of solutions.
